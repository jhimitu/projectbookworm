  - Understand what the disagreement is about. 
  - Share each side of the disagreement/point of view.
  - Discuss it and make a compromise/collaborate.

How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?
  - Stand-up meeting everyday
  - First, direct slack message to the person.
  - Second, one on one discussion with them. 

How and when will you escalate the conflict if your attempts are unsuccessful?
